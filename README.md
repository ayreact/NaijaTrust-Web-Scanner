# NaijaTrust Web Scanner

## Project info

**Overview**
NaijaTrust helps Nigerians understand how websites collect and use their data by scanning a site, extracting its privacy policy and observable data-collection behavior (cookies, trackers, forms), and returning a plain-English (and optional Pidgin) summary plus a simple risk rating. The MVP proves whether everyday users feel more informed and safer online.
